# Exam
You are expected to fork this repo and to commit to your fork after you complete each task, no matter the order you complete them in.

#### Tasks to complete
- Change the primary and accent colours of the theme.

- Change the not found page so that the url shows up in a different font. 

- Without editing the HTML, make the buttons in the counter component work. 

- Without deleting anything from the HTML, use a custom pipe to draw an asterisk based on the value of counter. For every 5 in the counter you should print one asterisk. So if the counter equaled 0 thru 4, there would be no stars. If counter was 5 thru 9, you would see one star. 10 thru 14, 2 stars. 15 thru 19, 3 stars. And so on. **The number value of the counter should also still appear.**

- Add a new component and service that get and display a random dad joke from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api#fetch-a-random-dad-joke 
  - You will need to add a header to you request. This link is one of many that will explain how to do it. https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-http-get-parameters-headers-urlsearchparams-requestoptions-example#headers
  - You will make the get request from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ with the headers set right. 
 
 - Add a working **routerLink** to your new component in the sidebar and ensure that the joke will reload every time that link is clicked.
